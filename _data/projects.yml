- title: "K-Score: Kalman Filter as a Principled Alternative to Reward Normalization in Reinforcement Learning"
  description: >
    Proposed a lightweight Kalman-filter-based reward normalization framework to replace heuristic Z-score normalization in policy gradient reinforcement learning.
    Developed both fixed and adaptive 1D Kalman filter modules for online return estimation, enabling dynamic adaptation to non-stationary reward distributions.
    Demonstrated improved convergence speed and stability on CartPole and LunarLander using REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, GAE, and PPO.
    Worked jointly with Quanxi Li; submitted and presented at the <a href="https://ml2025workshop.cn">New in ML 2025 Workshop</a>.

- title: "Multilingual Document Layout Analysis on Public Procurement Data"
  description: >
    Conducted few-shot layout analysis on multilingual CFT documents (German, French, Italian) provided by IntelliProcure.
    Benchmarked YOLOv10 and Transformer-based (LayoutXLM, LiLT) models under limited labeled data.
    Built pipeline for PDF preprocessing, region extraction, comparison, and qualitative evaluation.
    Evaluated model accuracy and inference time, with oral presentation of results.

- title: "Time Series Forecasting on Real Bank Transaction Data"
  description: >
    Collaborated with Prof. <a href="https://example.com">Lufei Huang</a> on a banking project using proprietary transaction data.
    Built a CNN-based model to forecast 7×7 matrix-style flows; achieved cosine similarity > 0.73.
    Developed full pipeline with preprocessing, normalization, visualization, and inference logging.
